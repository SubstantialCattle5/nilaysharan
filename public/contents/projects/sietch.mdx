> ## Introduction

I’ve long been unsettled by the fragility of our reliance on the **cloud.**
In many parts of the world, connectivity is erratic, censorship is real, and surveillance never sleeps.
Every time the internet falters or a service goes down, your data—and your trust—becomes hostage to infrastructure you don’t control.

Out of that uneasy truth, Sietch was born. A system engineered to survive when everything else fails. 
It syncs peer-to-peer, resists metadata leaks, and stays operable in blackout zones or disconnected regions. 
Whether you’re in a remote village, under heavy surveillance, or simply distrustful of centralized services, Sietch gives you back control.

I led the architecture and implementation of its core components:

- **Encrypted chunking** and **deduplication**, so that overlapping content isn’t duplicated and bandwidth is used smartly

- **Zero-trust design** ensuring keys never leave your control, metadata is minimized, and no central authority ever sees your data

- Discovery and synchronization over local **networks**, **mesh**, or even **sneakernet** — so connections aren’t a prerequisite

- A CLI-first, scriptable UX giving power users the flexibility to **automate**, **integrate**, and **inspect internals**

In building Sietch, I wrestled with deep trade-offs between security and usability, designed for adversarial environments, 
and modularized the system so advanced users can replace components (discovery, encryption, UI) easily

If you care about **sovereignty**, **resilience**, and **protecting** your data in the worst of times, I invite you to explore Sietch: try it, critique it, and help evolve it.

> ## Technical Details

Sietch creates self-contained encrypted vaults that can sync over LAN, sneakernet (USB drives), or weak WiFi networks. 
It operates fully offline, using chunked data, encryption, and peer-to-peer protocols to ensure your files 
are always protected.

> ### Core Features 

- **AES256/GPG/Chacha20 encryption** - Encryption is used to ensure the data is protected from unauthorized access.
- **Chunked data** - Data is chunked into smaller pieces to reduce the size of the data and to make it easier to sync.
- **Deduplication** - Deduplication is used to reduce the size of the data and to make it easier to sync.
- **Sneakernet synchronization** - Special configuration provided to sync over USB drives or even sneakernet.
- **P2P synchronization** - Synchronization is done using a p2p protocol to find other nodes in the network.
- **Gossip Discovery** - Discovery is done using a gossip protocol to find other nodes in the network.
- **CLI-first, scriptable UX** - The CLI is used to interact with the system and to automate the system.

>### Tech Stack Used

- **Golang** - Used to write the code for the project.
- **P2P** - protocols inspired from librsync and librsync-lite.
- **Github Actions** - Created a CI/CD pipeline to automatically verify the code, find out ai-assited contributions and build/publish the project.
- **Homebrew** - Created a homebrew formula to host the project.


>### Usage Examples 

- Scaffold a vault - `sietch scaffold --template <template-name> --name <vault-name>`
<Image src='/images/sietch_integration.png' alt='create-vault' width={1000} height={1000} />

- Add files or directories to a vault - `sietch add <file-or-directory-path> --vault <vault-name>`
<Image src='/images/sietch_add.png' alt='create-vault' width={1000} height={1000} />

- List all files in a vault and sort them by size - `sietch ls --long --sort size`
<Image src='/images/sietch_ls.png' alt='create-vault' width={1000} height={1000} />

- Deduplication Status - `sietch dedup status`
<Image src='/images/sietch_dedup.png' alt='create-vault' width={1000} height={1000} />

- Get files from the vault - `sietch get <file-or-directory-path>`
<Image src='/images/sietch_get.png' alt='create-vault' width={1000} height={1000} />
