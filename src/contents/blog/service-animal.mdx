# Service Animal: An Emotional Rollercoaster by Jamblu

## Introduction

"Service Animal" is an album crafted by Jamblu, an artist known also as Kartik Pillai hailing from New Delhi. The album's release in 2020 introduced seven songs that delve into themes of self-expression, self-love, and freedom. This work marks a departure from Jamblu's previous darker, experimental electronica style, embracing a more approachable, mellower sound.

## The Album's Essence

The album title and its cover art for "Service Animal" by Jamblu reflect a sense of camaraderie and encouragement that the artist either seeks or extends through his musical creations. The album cover features a childhood photograph set against a backdrop resembling a forest collage, symbolizing innocence and connection.

### Tracklist:

1. **If I Could Be Born Again**

   - Kicking off with "If I Could Be Born Again," the album embarks on a journey contemplating the prospect of starting anew and living a divergent life. The song intertwines smooth saxophones with wavering synth melodies, casting a bittersweet atmosphere that persists throughout the album.

2. **We Never Fight (Cause We Never Talk)**

   - Following is "We Never Fight (Cause We Never Talk)," a loveless tune reminiscent of the works of Peter Cat Recording Co. It paints a portrait of a fractured relationship marred by a lack of communication or intimacy. The vocals by Anand Viankara carry a sense of resignation and detachment, subtly conveying the artist's emotional disengagement despite obvious heartache.

3. **Surround Yourself With The People You Love (and who love you)**

   - "Surround Yourself With The People You Love (and who love you)" by Jamblu showcases the album's experimental flair through intricate electronic effects. The track exudes a raw energy that empowers listeners, while Jamblu's distorted vocals deliver the message of cherishing genuine connections: "Surround yourself with the people you love / And who love you / Cause they’re the ones who’ll always be there for you / No matter what you do."

4. **Take Your Time**

   - With "Take Your Time," Jamblu crafts an upbeat and optimistic piece evoking the nostalgia of childlike joy and innocence. The song incorporates playful synth sounds and infectious hooks, cultivating a joyful ambiance.

5. **Love Songs For Bad Friends**

   - "Love Songs For Bad Friends" emerges as a spiritual successor to "We Never Fight," expressing the artist's remorse and resentment over failed relationships and friendships. The song employs mournful piano chords and strings to create a solemn mood. Dhruv Bhola's vocals convey the artist's bitterness and anger towards former friends, yet also signal a readiness to release the past, with lyrics like "I’m over it / I don’t need you anymore."

6. **I Want to Live**
   - The album concludes with "I Want to Live," an instrumental track that serves as an outro, exuding a sense of serenity and tranquility through ambient sounds. This composition could symbolize the artist's inner peace achieved through his musical expression.

## Themes Explored

"Service Animal" by Jamblu isn't merely an album of sounds; it's an emotional rollercoaster capturing both the highs and lows. The artist illustrates that even indifference can be a form of affection, extending well-wishes with lines like "you’re happy, and warm." Amid expressions of regret and miscommunication, a glimmer of hope for redemption shines through. In a world where becoming like service animals is a risk, rising above is a cherished privilege—a pursuit worth undertaking.
